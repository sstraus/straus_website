# Building Software with AI Assistants

AI-powered development tools have fundamentally changed how I write software. Here's what I've learned from integrating them into my workflow.

## The Shift in Development

When I first started using AI assistants like Claude, I was skeptical. Could an AI really help with complex software development tasks?

After months of daily use, I can confidently say: **yes, absolutely**.

## What Works Well

### Code Generation

AI assistants excel at:

- **Boilerplate code** – Generating repetitive patterns quickly
- **Standard implementations** – Common algorithms and data structures
- **Documentation** – Writing clear, comprehensive docs
- **Test cases** – Generating edge cases you might miss

### Problem Solving

When stuck on a problem, AI assistants can:

- Suggest alternative approaches
- Explain complex concepts clearly
- Identify potential issues in your code
- Provide relevant examples

## What Requires Caution

AI isn't perfect. Be careful with:

- **Security-sensitive code** – Always review carefully
- **Complex business logic** – AI lacks domain context
- **Performance-critical sections** – Generated code may not be optimal
- **Outdated information** – Training data has cutoff dates

## My Workflow

Here's how I integrate AI into my development process:

1. **Start with intent** – Clearly describe what I want to build
2. **Iterate together** – Refine the solution through conversation
3. **Review everything** – Never blindly accept generated code
4. **Learn from it** – Use AI explanations to deepen understanding

## The Future

AI assistants are tools, not replacements. The best results come from:

- Understanding the fundamentals yourself
- Using AI to augment, not replace, your thinking
- Staying critical and curious

The developers who thrive will be those who learn to collaborate effectively with AI while maintaining their own expertise.
