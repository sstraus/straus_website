# Welcome to My Terminal

If you're reading this, you've successfully navigated my somewhat unconventional personal website. Congratulations!

## Why a Terminal?

When I set out to create a personal website, I wanted something that:

1. **Reflects my personality** – I spend most of my day in the terminal
2. **Stands out** – No cookie-cutter templates here
3. **Is interactive** – More engaging than a static page
4. **Is technically interesting** – A fun challenge to build

## How It Works

This entire site is built with vanilla JavaScript – no frameworks, no build tools. The "terminal" you're using is a custom implementation that:

- Simulates a macOS terminal window
- Processes commands just like a real shell
- Renders markdown content in terminal style
- Supports keyboard navigation and history

## Available Commands

Here's what you can do:

- `help` – See all available commands
- `about` – Learn more about me
- `blog` – Browse my articles
- `skills` – View my tech stack
- `contact` – Get in touch
- `clear` – Clear the screen

## What's Next?

I'll be posting articles about:

- Software development best practices
- AI and machine learning in development
- Interesting projects I'm working on
- Thoughts on the tech industry

Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions!
